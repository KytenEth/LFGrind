## Design & Style
### Theme & Aesthetic: Embrace a fantasy cyberpunk RPG style. The interface should evoke a dark, urban digital metropolis where ancient magic meets futuristic technology.
### Visual Elements:
- Use a dark, moody base palette accented by vibrant neon highlights (think glowing sigils and holographic quest markers).
Pallete:
    'cyber-neon': '#00ffaa',
    'cyber-teal': '#00b3a1',
    'cyber-aqua': '#00e5ff',
    'cyber-blue': '#0077ff',
- Integrate sleek, ultramodern UI components that blend with subtle mystical elements, like runic symbols or alchemical icons.
- Incorporate elements reminiscent of Riot Games’ Project X Skins: edgy, high-energy visuals with rich textures and layered digital effects.

### User Experience Priorities
Immersive Interaction: Ensure transitions, animations, and page layouts contribute to the sense of being in a vibrant digital realm.
 
Style References:
Use imagery and layout inspirations drawn from League of Legends Project Skins.
Incorporate futuristic fonts, neon accents, and dynamic animations that echo both sci-fi aesthetics and mythical lore.
